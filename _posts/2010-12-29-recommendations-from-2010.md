We&#8217;re wrapping up another year, so I thought of sharing pointers to some of the things that got me excited throughout 2010 while I was not burying my head in my thesis or packing for our move to Victoria.

In terms of books, last year around this time I was very excited by Javier Marías&#8217; trilogy, &#8220;[Tu Rostro Mañana](http://www.librarything.com/series/Your+Face+Tomorrow+%281%29 "Tu Rostro Mañana on LibraryThing").&#8221; I still haven&#8217;t read it, unfortunately, but I did read the older &#8220;[Corazón tan Blanco](http://www.librarything.com/work/115010 "Corazón tan Blanco on LibraryThing"),&#8221; and I loved its flowing prose and its subtle plot. I was quite surprised with Roberto Bolaño&#8217;s &#8220;[El Tercer Reich](http://www.librarything.com/work/9572458 "El Tercer Reich on LibraryThing")&#8220;&#8212;not by its quality (Bolaño is always fantastic), but by the discovery that he must have been, for a while at least, a boardgame geek: the novel narrates, with plenty of interest, a match of a game that seems to be &#8220;[The Rise and Decline of the Third Reich](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1563/rise-and-decline-of-the-third-reich "The Rise and Decline of the Third Reich on BoardgameGeek")&#8221; between a German nerd and a tortured South American. I know only two other novels that take a serious look at boardgaming (Kawabata&#8217;s &#8220;[The Master of Go](http://www.librarything.com/work/70773 "The Master of Go on LibraryThing")&#8221; and Nabokov&#8217;s &#8220;[The Defense](http://www.librarything.com/work/64633 "The Defense on LibraryThing")&#8220;); I love the former, and I have not read the latter.

I also plunged into Proust&#8217;s &#8220;[In Search of Lost Time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Search_of_Lost_Time "In Search of Lost Time on Wikipedia"),&#8221; which has taken me a little more than I expected (I&#8217;ve only just finished Volume III), but I&#8217;m thoroughly enjoying every page. It&#8217;s not just the hypnotic prose (and I wish I could read it in the original French), but the blindingly bright cognitive, psychological, and sociological insights&#8212;a humbling masterpiece.

Probably the best non-fiction book I read this year was Paul Edwards&#8217; history of the development of climate modeling, &#8220;[A Vast Machine](http://www.librarything.com/work/9816239 "A Vast Machine on LibraryThing").&#8221; It&#8217;s engaging, timely, and fairly accessible, while exploring the difficult epistemological questions of climate simulation. On a different topic, Richard Evans&#8217; historical [trilogy of the Third Reich](http://www.librarything.com/series/The+Third+Reich+%281%29 "The series on LibraryThing") is engrossing and informative, and probably the best I could ask for to understand that brutal period of history.

To get a fascinating individual perspective of that time, you should read or subscribe to the &#8220;[Orwell Diaries](http://orwelldiaries.wordpress.com/ "The Orwell Diaries")&#8221; blog, which posts entries from George Orwell&#8217;s journal seventy years to the day (so the most recent entry today is from December 29th, 1940, in the midst of Germany&#8217;s campaign of aerial bombings in the UK&#8212;thanks to Greg Wilson for the pointer). For more recent events, there are several blogs I came to love this year: [George Monbiot](http://www.monbiot.com/ "monbiot.com")&#8216;s provides [great commentary](http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2010/10/11/the-values-of-everything/ "see for instance this analysis on why progressive causes fare so poorly") on ecological and social affairs (and he engaged in [a wrenching debate](http://www.easterbrook.ca/steve/?p=1593 "Steve's post and the subsequent debate") with my PhD advisor, Steve Easterbrook, on the topic of the East Anglia emails). The New York Times&#8217; &#8220;[The Stone](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/category/the-stone/ "The Stone blog")&#8221; blog demonstrates that philosophy is [practical and relevant](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/03/hegel-on-wall-street/ "For instance, this on Hegel and Wall Street"). Boston.com&#8217;s &#8220;[The Big Picture](http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/ "The Big Picture")&#8221; is a jaw-dropping photo blog (thanks to Michael Tobis for the tip). The [New Yorker Fiction podcast](http://www.newyorker.com/online/podcasts/fiction "The Fiction podcast") features cool short story readings and discussions. And after the G20 meeting in Toronto, I discovered the [Waging Nonviolence blog](http://wagingnonviolence.org/ "Waging Nonviolence"), which among many inspiring news and reflections on non-violence pointed to [this essay on the futility of the Black Bloc](http://newsjunkiepost.com/2010/07/26/diversity-of-tactics-the-noise-before-defeat/ "The Noise Before Defeat") that I wish was more widely read.

I&#8217;ve mentioned some of the great things we&#8217;ve discovered in Victoria in the few months we&#8217;ve been there (the [delicious food from the Puerto Vallarta Amigos&#8217; taco truck](http://yorchopolis.wordpress.com/2010/10/09/tacos/ "Tacos in Victoria"), Lifecycles&#8217; [fruit picking project](http://yorchopolis.wordpress.com/2010/10/09/picking-apples/ "Apple picking!")), but there&#8217;s others I have not talked about: the [Good Food Box](http://fernwoodnrg.ca/urban-sustainability/good-food-box "Good Food Box in Victoria") (which is as great as [Toronto&#8217;s](http://www.foodshare.net/goodfoodbox01.htm "Good Food Box in Toronto"), except for the fact that deliveries are monthly, not biweekly); the [Springridge Commons](http://lifecyclesproject.ca/initiatives/springridge_commons/index.php "Springridge Commons") [permaculture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture "Wikipedia on Permaculture") garden and the [Haultain Boulevard&#8217;s street garden](http://www.flickr.com/photos/greenkeepers/3822740036/ "Haultain Boulevard photostream"), where anybody can come and pick any fruit, vegetable, or herb they like (just leave enough for the rest!); and [Transition Victoria](http://transitionvictoria.ning.com/ "Transition Victoria"), the local [Transition](http://transitionnetwork.org/ "Transition Network") initiative, of which I should talk more in a later post.

It wasn&#8217;t a great year for new movies for me: we rented plenty of wonderful classics, but I was mostly disappointed at the movie theatre. Two notable exceptions: the mexploitation extravaganza of &#8220;[Machete](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0985694/ "Machete on IMDB")&#8221; and the Toronto-loving geeky fantasy of &#8220;[Scott Pilgrim vs. the World](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0446029/ "Scott Pilgrim on IMDB").&#8221; It wasn&#8217;t a great year for boardgames either (though I&#8217;m holding out for &#8220;[The Resistance](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/41114/the-resistance "The Resistance on BoardgameGeek")&#8220;), except for the hours and hours I spent playing Go, a game of intimidating depth and beauty that I appreciate more with every match I play (I&#8217;m &#8220;yorchopolis&#8221; at the [Dragon Go Server](http://www.dragongoserver.net/index.php "Dragon Go Server"); feel free to invite me to a game!).

Some software tools and I&#8217;m done; these may be old news for you, depending on where you&#8217;re coming from: I discovered [Mendeley](http://www.mendeley.com/ "Mendeley website") for managing my library of academic papers and notes (after painfully parting without my annotated paper copies of hundreds of papers in Toronto), I started taking advantage of [Instapaper](http://www.instapaper.com/u "Instapaper website") to reduce the clutter of my browser tabs, and for task management I switched from [Toodledo](http://www.toodledo.com/ "Toodledo website") (which was alright) to [Omnifocus](http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus/ "Omnifocus website") (expensive, but it fits like a glove!).

That&#8217;s it, I think. I hope you enjoy these as much as I have, and I wish you a happy New Year!
