One more year behind us! Here are some of the things that I loved in 2014 and that you may enjoy, too:

Books! The oddest, most strangely beautiful one I found this year was Haskell&#8217;s &#8220;[The Forest Unseen](https://www.librarything.com/work/11720259)&#8220;. Part meditation, part scientific explanation of all that happens in a tiny section of a forest in the course of a year, it is intelligent without being patronizing, compassionate without being mushy, and constantly full of surprises.

Offill&#8217;s &#8220;[Dept. of Speculation](https://www.librarything.com/work/13909490)&#8220;, on the difficulty and beauty of marriage and parenthood, and on trying to achieve greatness (or, at least, to control the apartment&#8217;s pests) while being a parent, is a bit of a Trojan horse: it seems unassuming, but it unfolds in the mind after reading. Ferrante&#8217;s &#8220;[The Days of Abandonment](https://www.librarything.com/work/325477)&#8221; is about abandonment of the marital kind, and it is angry, desperate, hyperventilating, funny, perfect. McBride&#8217;s &#8220;[A Girl Is a Half Formed Thing](https://www.librarything.com/work/13972280)&#8220;, in contrast to Offill&#8217;s and Ferrante&#8217;s books, may be the hardest: hard to parse, but also to digest. McBride&#8217;s dark, pulsating, synaptic prose is often grammatically nonsensical, but it conveys fear, loss lust, and love beautifully.

Sjón&#8217;s &#8220;[The Whispering Muse](https://www.librarything.com/work/12537395)&#8221; overlays some of the greatest Western myths with modern, ordinary bigotry and pettiness; the result is exceptional. On the most page-turning end of the spectrum, Theroux&#8217;s post-apocalyptic &#8220;[Far North](https://www.librarything.com/work/7905936)&#8221; is both very smart and very enjoyable.

Fénéon&#8217;s &#8220;[Novels in Three Lines](https://www.librarything.com/work/2596895)&#8221; is a collection of very short news items that ran in a Paris newspaper about a hundred years ago. They are not all interesting or relevant, but they are expertly crafted, and the accumulated effect or reading so many snapshots of old violence, suffering, random chaos, and happiness is poetically complex. Parra&#8217;s &#8220;[Poemas para Combatir la Calvicie](https://www.librarything.com/work/1326131)&#8221; (in Spanish), an anthology of his &#8220;antipoetry&#8221;, is beautiful for its plainspokenness.

As for movies, I loved the calm aesthetic of &#8220;[Le Quattro Volte](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1646975/)&#8221; and the hallucinogenic rush of &#8220;[Vanishing Point](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067927/)&#8220;. &#8220;[Act of Killing](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2375605/)&#8221; is bizarre, horrifying; &#8220;[The Loneliest Planet](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1695405/)&#8221; shows a small hint of that horror to a Western backpacking couple and they find it perhaps too much to handle. &#8220;[Computer Chess](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2007360/)&#8221; is a masterpiece of awkward nerd-dom. You probably watched as much TV as I did, but if for any reason you missed &#8220;[Black Mirror](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2085059/)&#8221; or &#8220;[True Detective](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2356777/)&#8220;, they are both brilliant. One musical recommendation: the R&B covers from the [Detroit Cobras](http://thedetroitcobras.com/) are excellent.

My biggest boardgaming surprise this year was the complexity of the cooperative game &#8220;[Freedom](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/119506/freedom-underground-railroad)&#8220;, about emancipation and the Railroad Underground. It is not necessarily a fun experience—in fact, it is the most gut-wrenching game I&#8217;ve ever played, more art than game; educational gaming done right. On the actually fun side, &#8220;[Sheriff of Nottingham](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/157969/sheriff-nottingham)&#8220;, a bluffing, smuggling, and bribing game, is great fun, and &#8220;[Tzolk&#8217;in](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/126163/tzolk-mayan-calendar)&#8221; and &#8220;[Last Will](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/97842/last-will)&#8221; are both elegant and well-balanced; after several replays I don&#8217;t feel like I have a good grip on strategy on either of them, which is a good sign.

If you live in or visit Victoria, you should get truly wonderful coffee at Hey Happy! We&#8217;ve been going quite a bit to La Taquisa for tortilla soups and tacos. David Mincey&#8217;s &#8220;Chocolate Project&#8221;, usually at the Hudson Public Market, is on hiatus, but when it returns you should check it out, as it features outstanding chocolate from around the world. Finally, one of my regrets when we moved to Victoria from Toronto was missing out on Snakes and Lattes, but now, luckily, Victoria has an excellent substitute: [Interactivity](http://www.ibgcafe.com/), a board game café, has a very good library and yummy milkshakes to drink while you play those games with your friends.

I hope your 2014 was also full of love and good finds—feel free to let me know of stuff you liked in the comments. Happy New Year!
