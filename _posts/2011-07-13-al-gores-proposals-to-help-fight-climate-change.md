In [a very good article in Rolling Stone](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/climate-of-denial-20110622), Al Gore lays out the reasons for the sorry state of the climate change debate in the public arena. (He dishes out a lot of his criticism to the media; the media, true to form, seem to have interpreted the article as an attack on Obama.) He closes with five ways in which you can help fix things. Slightly abridged:

> First, become a committed advocate for solving the crisis. You can start with something simple: Speak up whenever the subject of climate arises. When a friend or acquaintance expresses doubt that the crisis is real, or that it&#8217;s some sort of hoax, don&#8217;t let the opportunity pass to put down your personal marker. The civil rights revolution may have been driven by activists who put their lives on the line, but it was partly won by average Americans who began to challenge racist comments in everyday conversations.
> 
> Second, deepen your commitment by making consumer choices that reduce energy use and reduce your impact on the environment. The demand by individuals for change in the marketplace has already led many businesses to take truly significant steps to reduce their global-warming pollution.
> 
> Third, join an organization committed to action on this issue.
> 
> Fourth, contact your local newspapers and television stations when they put out claptrap on climate — and let them know you&#8217;re fed up with their stubborn and cowardly resistance to reporting the facts of this issue. One of the main reasons they are so wimpy and irresponsible about global warming is that they&#8217;re frightened of the reaction they get from the deniers when they report the science objectively. So let them know that deniers are not the only ones in town with game. Stay on them! Don&#8217;t let up!
> 
> Finally, and above all, don&#8217;t give up on the political system. Even though it is rigged by special interests, it is not so far gone that candidates and elected officials don&#8217;t have to pay attention to persistent, engaged and committed individuals. (&#8230;) To make our elected leaders take action to solve the climate crisis, we must forcefully communicate the following message: &#8220;I care a lot about global warming; I am paying very careful attention to the way you vote and what you say about it; if you are on the wrong side, I am not only going to vote against you, I will work hard to defeat you — regardless of party. If you are on the right side, I will work hard to elect you.&#8221;
