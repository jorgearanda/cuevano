A few years ago I wrote [a pretty critical post](https://catenary.wordpress.com/2009/11/29/against-semat/) on the then-new [SEMAT initiative](http://semat.org/?page_id=2), which wanted to &#8220;refound software engineering&#8221; with a &#8220;solid theory, proven principles, and best practices&#8221;. Recently, Ivar Jacobson and others published a book (_&#8220;The Essence of Software Engineering&#8221;_) to introduce practitioners to the SEMAT &#8220;kernel&#8221;. The book is worse than I feared. Greg Wilson and I review it at the [Never Work in Theory blog](http://neverworkintheory.org/2013/08/12/review-essence-of-software-engineering.html).
