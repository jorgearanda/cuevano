You may have heard about this from me or Val already, but a heads-up if you haven&#8217;t: the _&#8220;maladjusted&#8221;_ play is happening in Victoria **tomorrow** at the Songhees Wellness Centre. It&#8217;s a Forum Theatre performance, meaning among other things that the play is interactive and meant to explore community problems; its topic is on the mental health system, treated from different angles. From the [description on the Eventbrite page](http://www.eventbrite.ca/e/maladjusted-the-mental-health-system-the-people-the-play-tickets-8337199789):

> ‘maladjusted’ engages audiences with powerful images and authentic voices weaving together three very personal narratives: A young teenager struggling with sadness over her friend’s suicide is misdiagnosed by her doctor; a young homeless man who is legitimately taking prescription meds gets thrown into dangerous circumstances by social workers, who are from within a mechanizing system, trying their best to help him; and finally, there is all of us, unable to adjust to the needs of a maladjusted mental health sector, who become potential agents for change.

Val has been helping coordinate the local production, and it looks like it&#8217;s going to be pretty good. There are only a few tickets left. I&#8217;ll be there, and I hope to see you there too.
