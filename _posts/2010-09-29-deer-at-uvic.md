I slowed down, and he (I think it&#8217;s a he?) followed me with his eyes. I spun my bike around to get a better look of him and snap a couple of photos with my phone, which he allowed for a moment before deciding to walk away.

I can&#8217;t get over these deer (I&#8217;ve been awed by several apparitions already); but apparently many people here have: they just bike or walk past them, and some local residents even dislike them because they make a mess of their gardens and munch on their flowers and veggies.
