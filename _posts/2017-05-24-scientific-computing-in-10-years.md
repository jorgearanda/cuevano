title: Scientific computing in 10 years

Greg Wilson, being the gloomy jaded pessimist he is,
[thinks leading-edge programmers will be doing scientific computing in JavaScript in 10 years](http://third-bit.com/2017/05/22/numerical-javascript.html).
I disagreeâ€”I don't know what these programmers will be using then,
but to the extent that they will be building on currently mainstream technologies
I think it will continue being R and Python, rather than JavaScript.
We [placed a bet on it](https://twitter.com/gvwilson/status/866750475374403585);
this post is here for reference.

Going for him,
Greg has the [most popular language today](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017#technology-programming-languages),
which, from a humble and rushed start in our browsers,
continues to shift shape and burrow in the most [unlikely](http://johnny-five.io/) [places](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/write-scripts-for-the-mongo-shell/),
and to prove all of its naysayers wrong.
Against that,
I have technologies that have ingrained themselves in the scientific community,
which have [fast](http://www.numpy.org/),
[usable](http://jupyter.org/),
and [sophisticated](https://www.tensorflow.org/) modules that took many years to build and get right,
and which offer newcomers a different career path and paradigm,
spiraling out of data and formulas
(rather than out of the browser)
into the rest of the world.

Whoever wins the bet,
it should be a fun dinner in 2027,
and I'm looking forward to it.
