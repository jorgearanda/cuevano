Keeping up with my little tradition of sharing stuff I liked at the end of the year, here are some recommendations from 2013.

Perhaps the book I enjoyed the most was Saunders&#8217; [&#8220;Tenth of December&#8221;](http://www.librarything.com/work/12652881). Its short stories have the kind of warmth that comes from compassion in the face of (as opposed to in ignorance of) cruelty. Catton&#8217;s [&#8220;The Luminaries&#8221;](http://www.librarything.com/work/13687338), set in the New Zealand gold rush, is great, too: thematic, thrilling, brainy yet mystical. [Pullman&#8217;s retelling of the Brother Grimm&#8217;s tales](http://www.librarything.com/work/12743853) is fresh and snappy, and Hamid&#8217;s [&#8220;How To Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia&#8221;](http://www.librarything.com/work/13106590) is a good antidote to world-lit fluff.

I loved the poetry collection [&#8220;Place&#8221;](http://www.librarything.com/work/12459031), by Jorie Graham. Its poems are strange miracles: systemic, yet focused on instants; comprehensive, yet intimate. Villalobos&#8217; [&#8220;Fiesta en la madriguera&#8221;](http://www.librarything.com/work/11553725) (in Spanish) is a fun, surreal take on excess told from the perspective of the pampered scion of a drug lord. And while Daylight&#8217;s interview with Peter Naur, [&#8220;Pluralism in Software Engineering&#8221;](http://lonelyscholar.com/node/7), is quite uneven, it has important insights into software development and academia that continue to be forgotten or put aside, to everyone&#8217;s detriment.

A couple of good movies: [&#8220;No&#8221;](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2059255/), on the Pinochet referendum campaign, with its ambivalent, subtle take on social and political change, and [&#8220;The Queen of Versailles&#8221;](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2125666/), a documentary on a ridiculous and ridiculously wealthy American family going through hard times. I&#8217;d recommend [&#8220;Gravity&#8221;](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1454468/), but I doubt it needs recommendation. I also enjoyed the genre mix of the British TV version of [&#8220;Life on Mars&#8221;](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0478942/), and the silliness of [&#8220;Archer&#8221;](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1486217/). As for music, I liked the bassy intensity of Savages&#8217; [&#8220;Silence Yourself&#8221;](http://savagesband.com/), and Chris Thile&#8217;s [album of Bach&#8217;s sonatas and partitas](http://www.nonesuch.com/artists/chris-thile) played on the mandolin.

I was able to run again, injury-free, throughout the year, largely thanks to daily (and initially painful) stretches on a [foam roller](http://www.amazon.com/Black-High-Density-Foam-Rollers/dp/B0040NJOA0/). It&#8217;s such an unassuming, cheap, yet useful accessory. I must have tasted every olive oil and balsamic vinegar at [Olive the Senses](http://olivethesenses.com/) half a dozen times (and if you are in Victoria you should, too). Finally, while I&#8217;ve been intimidated by electronic tinkering almost all my life, the [Arduino Experimenter Kit](http://www.adafruit.com/products/170) was a very straightforward way to get me started on designing circuits and devices (and check out [node-ardx](http://node-ardx.org/), a great resource to go through the experimenter kit exercises using Node).

That&#8217;s it. Happy New Year!
