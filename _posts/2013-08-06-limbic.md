These have been times of important anniversaries for me. In the past few days I&#8217;ve celebrated ten years in Canada, one year out of academia, and three months with [Limbic Consulting](http://www.limbicconsulting.ca/).

In 2003, when Val and I moved to Toronto and I started my Master in Computer Science degree, I thought that my stay in both Canada and academia would be temporary. A couple of years, at most. But I discovered I liked both too much—enough to think of staying in them permanently. Years later, as it turned out, Canada is [happily still our home](http://cuevano.ca/2012/07/canadian-citizenship/), but I became disenchanted with the academic house, [or rather with my corner of it](http://cuevano.ca/2012/05/why-not-a-professorship/), and left.

After a stint at [Terapeak](http://www.terapeak.com/) (a company where I learned much, but whose goals diverged with mine) I joined Limbic. I&#8217;m very glad I did. Limbic is a small firm ([which I think is great](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jaranda/pubs/SmallStrengths-RESC2010.pdf)) filled with [smart, fun, kind, multidisciplinary people](http://www.limbicconsulting.ca/our-group/). The office feels equal parts grad lab, electronics workbench, Agile shop, and surreal cave.

We&#8217;ve got an [art gallery](http://www.limbicmedia.ca/gplusplus/) attached to our workplace, a tickle trunk with wigs and costumes to use in standup meetings (and whenever the conversation gets heated), a dictionary of modern thought and back issues of [Make](http://makezine.com/) as our washroom reading material, great coffee, and healthy snacks. Most importantly, the projects we are working on are both technically challenging and fun, and we have the autonomy to work on them the way we think is best. It&#8217;s a pretty unique place, and an exciting time for me.
