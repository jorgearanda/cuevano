title: Site Migration
layout: post
---
You may notice things are a bit different here:
I have migrated from Wordpress to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/),
partly to minimize exposure to advertisers,
partly to reduce hosting costs
(the site is now hosted on S3),
and partly to scratch the itch I've had for a while to explore static site generators and serverless hosting.

The one downside to this is that the new site does not have comments,
which I used to enjoy quite a bit.
I thought about adding [Disqus](https://disqus.com/),
but this would mean allowing one more third party to track your browsing habits,
and I would either have to pay for the service or allow them to display ads,
which I did not want to do.
So: if you want to comment on a post,
I would welcome your thoughts directly on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yorchopolis), Facebook, or over email or coffee!
