Many of the [most impactful charities](https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities) around the world
are not set to receive tax-deductible donations from Canada.
If you want to donate to them in a tax-deductible way,
you need to find a registered charity in Canada that will reliably pass along your donations,
and provide you with a tax receipt.

These days,
the best way to do that is to donate to one or several of the campaigns
set up by [Rethink Charity Forward](https://rcforward.org/) (RC Forward),
within the [CHIMP](https://chimp.net/) platform.
This is how I manage a good chunk of my monthly donations
(to a [Global Health Fund](https://chimp.net/campaigns/rc-forward-global-health-fund),
to [GiveDirectly](https://chimp.net/campaigns/givedirectly-39a1dc87-4290-450e-bd45-8380861da72e),
to an [Animal Welfare Fund](https://chimp.net/campaigns/rc-forward-animal-welfare-fund),
and a small sum to contribute to [RC Forward's operations](https://chimp.net/campaigns/rethink-charity-forward-operations)).

The reason I post this is that,
due to a CHIMP promotion,
for the next week I can send three of you a CHIMP referral which,
should you accept it,
**will give both your new account and my current account
$10 to donate to the charities of our choice**.

That's potentially a total of $60 which can go to very worthwhile causes.
Please consider joining!
If you want one of these referrals,
let me know, soon, at jorge.aranda (AT) cuevano.ca,
and I'll send it your way.
