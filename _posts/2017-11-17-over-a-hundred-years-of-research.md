title: Over a Hundred Years of Research

I agree with everything Greg Wilson wrote [here](http://third-bit.com/2017/11/17/freakonomics-but-for-good.html),
and I had been thinking along similar lines after recent incidents such as:

* the haughty response from sociologists to [Cathy O'Neil's New York Times op-ed](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/14/opinion/academia-tech-algorithms.html),
  in which she despairs at the lack of academic involvement in algorithmic accountability
* the sarcastic replies to [Neil DeGrasse Tyson's observation](https://twitter.com/neiltyson/status/904861739329708034?lang=en) that schools don't usually teach us about
  how to go from data to wisdom
* the [sneers at Twitter's seeming inability](https://twitter.com/zeynep/status/931002770785783808) to deal with the social problems in its platform

In all of these cases,
reactions from humanities academics tend to express an exasperation with how little society minds them.
"Ha, Cathy O'Neil is laughable, there's _entire research centres_ dedicated to this!"
"Pfff, Neil DeGrasse Tyson, may I introduce you to the fields of Epistemology and Science and Technology Studies?
You may like them."
"Geez Twitter, we've been researching status for over a hundred years. Why doesn't anybody study this?"
And, to some extent, I see where these critiques come from.
After all, if you have dedicated your life to the study of a problem,
and the world seems to ignore your work,
or to pretend you're not around,
it's understandable if you feel frustrated.
But I think this natural reaction is misguided.

As I see it, the mission of academia is twofold:
to _explore_ outstanding questions,
and to _explain_ our understanding to the rest of society.
Research without dissemination leads to isolation, to the ivory tower;
dissemination without research, to stagnation.
From this stance,
evidence that the public knows nothing about your decades of volumes and treatises
should be classified as a failure of _your field_;
a failure to fulfill your mission.
The healthy reaction to cases like the above should be
"hmm, how can we make ourselves clearer?",
not "lol look at these ignoramuses."

I did interdisciplinary research.
Coming from computer science,
I studied, and truly enjoyed, sociology, epistemology, philosophy, and organizational science.
But it was not easy to crack them,
and most people in the mainstream don't have the time, the resources, or the inclination to do a second degree.
The idea that the average person is going to meet you where you are [is a fantasy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpzVc7s-_e8);
the task and the challenge is to meet them where _they_ are.
So, if your field is over a hundred years oldâ€”
where are its [entry points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_for_Future_Presidents) for lay people?
Where are the texts that present the findings that citizens and policy makers should know,
[in an accessible format](https://skepticalscience.com/docs/Debunking_Handbook.pdf) and without sacrificing substance?
Where are the articles or blog posts where regular folks can [learn about new developments](https://arstechnica.com/science/)?
If these don't exist,
or if they can't yet be produced because research is inconclusive,
or because these are genuinely thorny concepts,
then that's hardly a failure to pin on the confused lay person,
and you should not [wear your rarefied isolation as a badge of honour](https://jeffreymoro.com/2017/11/14/the-price-of-admission/).
