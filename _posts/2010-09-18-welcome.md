Welcome to my shiny new personal blog!

As you may already know, I&#8217;ve been keeping another blog ([Catenary](http://catenary.wordpress.com/ "My old blog")) for a few years, and I intended to make that my one and only blog, to keep things simple for <img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4" title="Our backyard" src="http://yorchopolis.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/img_2130.jpg?w=300" alt="Our backyard" width="300" height="225" />everyone. But I feel I&#8217;ve been restraining myself from posting stuff I wanted to post because the academic side of things kind of took over the blog&#8212;I know I have readers who don&#8217;t care about my research and others who don&#8217;t care about my personal life.

So I decided to split that blog in two. I&#8217;ll keep Catenary for work stuff, and this new blog for more personal stuff: our life in Victoria, photos, book or movie recommendations, games, whatever else comes up. I also decided to write some of my posts in Spanish here, now and then. If you want to comment, feel free to use either language. Thanks for reading!
