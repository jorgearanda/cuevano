The mayoral election in Victoria is coming up in November 15th, and for once choosing a candidate was not an easy decision. I ended up doing quite a bit of research, both on the mayoral candidates and on council candidates, and I thought it best to share my conclusions for any undecideds still left.

For mayor, of course, the choice was between Fortin and Helps. I did not understand the discontent over Fortin. He&#8217;s progressive, environmental, compassionate, and apparently a great guy. Victoria is improving through his tenure. The budget overruns with the Johnson Bridge should be expected, and the issue seems just an effort to rally up voters who define themselves as &#8220;taxpayers&#8221; exclusively. So as an incumbent he looks greatâ€”except we have a choice, in Helps, of another seemingly progressive, environmental, strong candidate. I had friends endorse either candidate very convincingly. So I had to do quite a bit of city council motion reading, debate-watching, canvasser-questioning, and so on.

In the end I chose Fortin. One reason is that he is an experienced mayor over whom I have no objections. Another reason is that, as I understand from a couple of sources, Helps&#8217; relation with council is strained, and since those council members are likely not going anywhere, we might end up with a more dysfunctional council if she wins. But the greater reason is that, through my research, I grew convinced that while Fortin is authentically convinced of progressive causes, Helps has more of a flexible, &#8220;pragmatic&#8221; position. The positive spin on Helps&#8217; malleability is that she listens to the public on the issues that matter to them. The negative, as suggested by her stance on issues like the Mason St development site or the Crystal Pool vote, is that there&#8217;s a chance, not high but fair, that she will take a conservative or centrist position unless there&#8217;s an outcry big enough for her to backtrack. That could get tiring. [She says that she does not want to be placed within a left-right continuum](http://focusonline.ca/?q=node/665); I would like a mayor that is comfortable working and deciding from the left.

Council (each voter can vote for up to eight candidates) was a difficult decision too, mainly because there were (a) many candidates, and (b) few credible ones. Choosing the first five or six was easy; the rest was tough. A good tool to decide was [the Dogwood Initiative&#8217;s survey of candidates](http://www.localvote2014.ca/victoria). I am still a bit unsure on two of the candidates I chose, though I&#8217;m afraid their chances are low anyway.

The most difficult, vaguest decision was for School Board Trustees (we can vote for up to nine). There are very few materials to help one decide, and, again, not very many credible candidates. Most say the same things, mostly about wanting to either keep good public services or being financially responsible, and reading between the lines of their small differences is difficult.

So here we go, my choices for this election (* indicates most uncertainty/second thoughts):

**Mayor** &#8211; Dean Fortin

**Council**

  * Marianne Alto
  * Ben Issit
  * Erik Kaye
  * Jeremy Loveday
  * John Luton
  * Pamela Madoff
  * Ian Hoar (*)
  * Charlayne Thornton-Joe (*)

**School Board**

  * Edith Loring-Kuhanga
  * Diane McNally
  * Deborah Nohr
  * Rob Paynter
  * Jordan Watters
  * Nicole Duncan (*)
  * Bev Horsman (*)
  * Ruth MacIntosh (*)
  * Ann Whiteaker (*)

If you feel I included some bizarre choices here, or that I&#8217;m missing a really fantastic candidate, I would love it if you let me know. Remember to go vote!
