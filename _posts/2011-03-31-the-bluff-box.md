Victoria readers (and especially Fernwood neighbours): a friend of mine is collaborating with a Metchosin farmer to bring local, organic, delicious food weekly from Sea Bluff Farm to Fernwood, from June to November. They called it [The Bluff Box](http://www.bluffbox.blogspot.com/ "The Bluff Box's website"). It&#8217;s similar to a [CSA program](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community-supported_agriculture "Community-supported agriculture, on Wikipedia"), except you pay as you go: $25 for a small box, $40 for the family-size box. I hope you sign up&#8212;we need 20 committed customers to get this going!
