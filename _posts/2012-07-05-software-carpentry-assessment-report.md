One of the things I&#8217;ve been doing over the past six months is an assessment of the effects of the [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) program on its participants. It involved surveys, dozens of interviews, and observations. I&#8217;m happy with the results, and glad I got the chance to do this. I delivered my report today, and it&#8217;s now available to the public ([PDF](http://software-carpentry.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/aranda-assessment-2012-07.pdf)). If you prefer, you can read the Executive Summary at the [Software Carpentry blog](http://software-carpentry.org/2012/07/independent-assessment-of-the-past-six-months/).
