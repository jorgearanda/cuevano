Long time without posting, but I&#8217;m back. To break the silence, here is a quote from Lucretius I like, as cited by Montaigne.

> For when he saw that nearly all that use demands
> 
> Already was prepared for use by mortal hands,
> 
> That men were powerful in honor and in fame,
> 
> In riches affluent, proud in their sons&#8217; good name,
> 
> Yet nonetheless within were anxious in their heart,
> 
> In painful quarrels of the mind forced to take part:
> 
> Then Epicurus knew the vessel caused the vice;
> 
> That all good things that enter, of whatever price,
> 
> Within us, by that vessel&#8217;s vice, became corrupt.

I remembered it because of the news and reviews about Stephen Greenblatt&#8217;s new book onÂ _De Rerum Natura_. My copy of Lucretius still sits unread in my shelf, patiently waiting for me. I think I should attend to it&#8230;
