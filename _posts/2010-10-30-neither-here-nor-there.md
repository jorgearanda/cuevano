You may have heard that Toronto elected a new mayor this week, a man about whom the best I can say is that he has a pretty potent voice. I was dreading his election for a while before we moved to Victoria, since I started reading more and more angry comments in online news articles on Miller, the previous mayor, and seeing fellows with &#8220;Rob Ford&#8221; buttons on the subway. On election night I was glued to my computer, exasperated with the results, reading anything I could find on the topic, and wondering how will the new political situation play out.

A couple of days later, after reading some article on Ford to Val over dinner, I realized there was something incongruent going on with me: though I cared very much about what would happen to Toronto under him, I didn&#8217;t even know the name of the mayor of Victoria, the city in which we _actually_ live, much less his policies or initiatives. It was as if my mind was still living in Toronto and I refused (or didn&#8217;t care) to grow roots in my new town.

And I noticed this had happened to me before, when we moved from Le√≥n to Toronto. I would be reading Mexican news intensely, while I barely cared about local Canadian politics. Back then we thought we&#8217;d only be in Toronto for a couple of years&#8212;in parallel to our current situation&#8212;, which perhaps made me feel uncommitted to my new environment. But eventually I started to care more about Toronto, to feel an inner warmth whenever I returned from a trip, and to get informed and involved in my community. I kept interested in Mexican affairs, of course, but differently: from afar, not from an artificial within. My interest or lack of interest for local politics was a symptom of my degree of adaptation to my new home. I can see it happening again today.

So now my life is split in three places: the one I first knew, and that grows slightly more foreign every time I visit; the one I just left, to which my unconscious still takes me in my dreams and worries; and the one where I am and should be, still rather unknown and strange, until I gradually decide to truly turn to look and discover it.
