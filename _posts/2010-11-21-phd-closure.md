Last week I attended my convocation at the University of Toronto. It was a long and fairly boring ceremony, but I think I needed it: finishing a doctorate is one of the most anticlimactic events there are, considering the effort it takes to do it! I think the problem is that there are too many &#8220;almost there&#8221; points, or at least there were in my case:

  * You finish a decent draft of your thesis, but you realize there&#8217;s still lots of rough edges to polish. Okay!
  * You hand in your &#8220;final draft&#8221; to your committee. You&#8217;re proud of it. Yay! But you can&#8217;t celebrate yet: you need to prepare for the exam.
  * You pass the exam! But now you have a list of changes to make to your thesis, and you better do them quickly if you&#8217;re pressed for time (as I was) and if the scheduling window of the external or Senate defense is narrow (as mine was).
  * You hand in your thesis with the changes your committee requested. It took you a while, mainly because the thought of editing the Thing is dreadful. Never mind, though, it&#8217;s done. Yay again! But of course you still can&#8217;t celebrate: you need to prepare for the external defense (and for the [snake fight](http://www.mcsweeneys.net/2010/11/19burns.html "McSweeney's Snake Fight FAQ")).
  * You pass the defense! Woo hoo! You&#8217;re unofficially a Doctor now! Everyone calls you that. Except you still have a significant list of corrections for That Blasted Document you call your thesis.
  * In the solitude of your desk, you drag yourself to make those final changes. At some point in the middle of the night, you send it to your advisor; then you crawl to bed.
  * Hours or days later you get an email: your advisor accepted the changes. You upload the final version to the University&#8217;s database. A day later you get back an email saying that your upload failed because you didn&#8217;t name your PDF file quite the right way. You fix the filename and resubmit. You&#8217;re done.

And that&#8217;s it! &#8220;Not with a bang, but a whimper.&#8221; So after all, after so many false endings, I felt as if I wasn&#8217;t quite there yet. I would go to work every day as a &#8220;postdoctorate fellow,&#8221; which implies I&#8217;m done with school, yet except for a few moments I would slip back to that student frame of mind, with the sole difference that I wouldn&#8217;t have a thesis to write anymore.

It&#8217;s too early to say if it truly worked in giving me closure, but I&#8217;m glad I did it.
