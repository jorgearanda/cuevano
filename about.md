I am Jorge Aranda, and this site is for my personal posts and texts.

I am a Lead Scientist and Software Developer
at [Limbic Media](http://limbicmedia.ca/)/[Limbic Consulting](http://limbicconsulting.ca/),
an interdisciplinary technology company that tackles unconventional engineering challenges.
Before my latest incarnation I was an academic,
studying coordination and communication in software organizations,
first at the University of Toronto, where I did [my PhD](/pdfs/SharedUnderstanding.pdf),
and later at the University of Victoria, where I was a postdoctoral researcher.
I also made relatively brief stops at Microsoft Research and IBM along the way.
Before *that* life,
I was a freelance software development consultant in Mexico.

I am originally Mexican, and a naturalized Canadian.
I like reading and writing, running, vegetable gardening, cooking, coding, and boardgaming.
I love Camus, Borges, Bolaño, Ibargüengoitia, Eliot, Proust,
Brecht, Beckett, Stoppard, Feyerabend, Varo, Lynch, Fellini, and Bergman.
I admire both Epicureans and Stoics,
though on balance I think the Epicureans have it right,
and I would like to follow on their footsteps.
I live in Victoria, Canada,
with my partner [Val](http://valcortes.wordpress.com/), our kids, Aurora and Xavi, and our cat, Mushi.
