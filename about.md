I am Jorge Aranda, and this site is my personal blog.

I am a Principal Software Development Engineer at [Workday](https://www.workday.com/).
I have been developing software full time since 2012.

Before this latest incarnation I was an academic,
studying coordination and communication in software organizations,
first at the University of Toronto, where I did [my PhD](/pdfs/SharedUnderstanding.pdf),
and later at the University of Victoria, where I was a postdoctoral researcher.

You can find more details about my career in [my résumé](/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Jorge-Aranda-Resume.pdf).

I am originally Mexican, and a naturalized Canadian.
I like reading and writing, running, vegetable gardening, cooking, coding, and boardgaming.
I love Camus, Borges, Bolaño, Ibargüengoitia, Eliot, Proust,
Brecht, Beckett, Stoppard, Feyerabend, Varo, Lynch, Fellini, and Bergman.
I admire both Epicureans and Stoics,
though on balance I think the Epicureans have it right,
and I would like to follow on their footsteps.
I live in Victoria, Canada,
with my partner [Val](http://valcortes.wordpress.com/), our kids, and a lot of chickens.
